      <p>
        The <a>DeviceLightEvent</a> interface provides information about the

        terms of lux units.

        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single

      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
        this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]],
        as this specification uses that specification and terminology.

      <h2>
        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Privacy risks can arise when this specification is used in combination
        with other functionality or when used over time, specifically with the
        risk of correlation of data and user identification through
        fingerprinting. Web application developers using these JavaScript APIs
        should consider how this information might be correlated with other
        information and the privacy risks that might be created. The potential
        risks of collection of such data over a longer period of time should
        also be considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variations in implementation light level values as well as event firing
        rates offer the possibility of fingerprinting to identify users.
        Browser implementations may reduce the risk by limiting event rates
        available to web application developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the same JavaScript code using the API can be used simultaneously in
        different window contexts on the same device it may be possible for
        that code to correlate the user across those two contexts, creating
        unanticipated tracking mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Browser implementations should consider providing the user an
        indication of when the sensor is used and allowing the user to disable
        sensing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web application developers that use this specification should perform a
        privacy assessment of their application taking all aspects of their
        application into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event defined in this specification is only fired in the
        <a>top-level browsing context</a> to avoid the privacy risk of sharing
        the information defined in this specification with contexts unfamiliar
        to the user. For example, a mobile device will only fire the event on
        the active tab, and not on the background tabs or within iframes.

          Extensions to <a>Window</a> Interface

        <p>
          The <code>ondevicelight</code> event handler and its corresponding
          event handler event type <a>devicelight</a> MUST be supported as an
          IDL attribute by all objects implementing the <a>Window</a>
          interface.

          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          When the <a>current light level</a> changes, the <a>user agent</a>
          MUST queue a task to <a>fire a device light event</a> at the
