          Implementers need to be aware that this specification is not stable
          and may change in incompatible ways. We anticipate that it will be
          updated to be based on <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sensors/">
          Generic Sensor API</a>.

          Implementers interested in implementing this specification should
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/ambient-light">subscribe to the

        The functionality described in this specification was initially
        specified as part of the
        <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/default/sensor-api/Overview.html">
        Sensor API</a> but has been extracted in order to be more
        straightforward to implement, and in order to produce a specification
        that could be implemented on its own merits without interference with
        other features.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The <a>DeviceLightEvent</a> interface provides information about the
        ambient light levels, as detected by the device's light detector, in
        terms of lux units.
      </p>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries/#light-level">
        'light-level' media feature</a> [[MEDIAQUERIES4]] provides more granular,
        less precise, information about the ambient light level.

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the
        interfaces that it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs
        defined in this specification must implement them in a manner
        consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL
        specification [[!WEBIDL]], as this specification uses that
        specification and terminology.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        The <code><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#eventhandler">
        EventHandler</a></code> interface represents a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#idl-callback-functions">callback function</a> used for <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#event-handlers">event
      handlers</a> as defined in [[!HTML5]]. </p>
      <p>
        The concepts <dfn><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#queue-a-task">
        queue a task</a></dfn>,
        <dfn><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#fire-a-simple-event">
        fires a simple event</a></dfn>, and <dfn>
        <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context">
        top-level browsing context</a></dfn> are defined in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms <dfn><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#event-handlers">
        event handlers</a></dfn> and
        <dfn><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#event-handler-event-type">
        event handler event types</a></dfn> are defined in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Event constructor behavior is defined in
        <dfn><a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#constructing-events">
        constructing events</a></dfn> chapter in [[!DOM4]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The concepts <dfn>
        <a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#constructing-events">
        create an event</a></dfn> and <dfn>
        <a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#firing-events">
        fire an event</a></dfn> are defined in [[!DOM4]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>current light level</dfn> is a value that represents the ambient
        light levels around the hosting device in lux units.

      <h2>Security and privacy considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy risks can arise when this specification is used in
        combination with other functionality or when used over time,
        specifically with the risk of correlation of data and user
        identification through fingerprinting. Web application developers
        using these JavaScript APIs should consider how this information might
        be correlated with other information and the privacy risks that might
        be created. The potential risks of collection  of such data over a
        longer period of time should also be considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variations in implementation light level values as well as event firing
        rates offer the possibility of fingerprinting to identify users.
        Browser implementations may reduce the risk by limiting event rates
        available to web application developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the same JavaScript code using the API can be used simultaneously in
        different window contexts on the same device it may be possible for
        that code to correlate the user across those two contexts, creating
        unanticipated tracking mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Browser implementations should consider providing the user an
        indication of when the sensor is used and allowing the user to disable
        sensing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web application developers that use this specification should perform a
        privacy assessment of their application taking all aspects of their
        application into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event defined in this specification is only fired in the
        <a>top-level browsing context</a> to avoid the privacy risk of
        sharing the information defined in this specification with contexts
        unfamiliar to the user. For example, a mobile device will only fire
        the event on the active tab, and not on the background tabs or
        within iframes.

        <h2>Extensions to <a>Window</a> Interface</h2>
        <p>
          The HTML5 specification [[!HTML5]] defines a <a>Window</a> interface,
          which this specification extends:
        </p>
        <dl title="partial interface Window" class="idl">

          The <code id="widl-Window-ondevicelight">ondevicelight</code>
          event handler and its corresponding
          event handler event type <code>devicelight</code> MUST be supported
          as an IDL attribute by all objects implementing the <a>Window</a>
          interface.

          <code id="widl-DeviceLightEventInit-value"></code>
          attribute of the <a>DeviceLightEvent</a>
          interface MUST return the value it was initialized to. When the
          object is created, this attribute MUST be initialized to positive
          Infinity. It represents the <a>current light level</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          The precise lux value reported by different devices in the same light
          can be different, due to differences in detection method, sensor
          construction etc.
        </div>
        <p>
          When a <a>user agent</a> is required to <dfn>fire a device
          light event</dfn>, the <a>user agent</a> MUST run the
          following steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="rule">
          <li>
            <a>Create an event</a> that uses the <a>DeviceLightEvent</a>
            interface, with the name <code>devicelight</code>, which
            bubbles, is not cancelable, and has no default action, that also
            meets the following conditions:
            <ol>
              <li>
                If the implementation is unable to report the <a>current
                light level</a>, initialize the <code>value</code>
                attribute to positive Infinity, otherwise initialize the
                attribute to the <a>current light level</a>.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          When the <a>current light level</a> changes, the <a>user agent</a>
          MUST queue a task to <a>fire a device light event</a>
          at the <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>Window</a> object.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          The definition of granularity i.e. how often the event is fired is
          left to the implementation. Implementations can fire the event if
          they have reason to believe that the page does not have sufficiently
          fresh data.
